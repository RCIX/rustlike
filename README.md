# rustlike
Roguelike lab written in Rust. Playground for mechanics and learning tech.

# Todo

 * Devise and implement simple state machine for menus including conrod
 * Replace use of Piston sprite library with direct Image load and use - I don't need the abstraction or wrapper
 * Implement roguelike player logic (vision, level, movement)
